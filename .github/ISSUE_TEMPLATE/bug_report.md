## How are you running OpenRewrite?
<!--
Are you using the Maven plugin, Gradle plugin, Moderne CLI, Moderne.io or something else?
Is your project a single module or a multi-module project?

Can you share your configuration so that we can rule out any configuration issues?

Is your project public? If so, can you share a link to it?
Code snippets can also be shared privately via [our public Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rewriteoss/shared_invite/zt-nj42n3ea-b~62rIHzb3Vo0E1APKCXEA).
-->
I am using the Maven plugin, and my project is a single module project.
```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.openrewrite.maven</groupId>
  <artifactId>rewrite-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.2.3</version>
  <configuration>
    ... 
  </configuration>
</plugin>
```

## What is the smallest, simplest way to reproduce the problem?
<!--
Sometimes the logs indicate a recipe stumbled over a particular pattern of code.
If you can share a code snippet that reproduces the issue, that will help us fix it faster.
We also accept [pull requests that merely replicate an issue](https://github.com/openrewrite/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-fixes), as a step up to a full fix.

A code snippet can be something simple like this, or similar for other languages:
-->
```java
class A {
    void foo(String bar) {
        int i = 5;
    }
}
```

## What did you expect to see?
<!--
A code snippet, or a description of the behavior you expected helps us write a test to ensure the issue is fixed.
-->
```java
class A {
    void foo(String bar) {
        int i = 5;
    }
}
```

## What did you see instead?
<!--
A code snippet, or a description of the behavior you saw instead of the above expected result.
-->
```java
class A {
    void foo(String bar) {
        int i = 5;
    }
}
```

## What is the full stack trace of any errors you encountered?
<!--
When errors occur, please include the output of `--stacktrace` for Gradle or `--debug` for Maven.
-->
```
stacktrace output here
```
