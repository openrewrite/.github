## Get fast, repeatable source code refactoring
[OpenRewrite](https://www.moderne.io/community) (founded and managed by [Moderne](https://www.moderne.io/)) is a community-driven open source project that enables developers to effectively eliminate technical debt within their repositories. It consists of an auto-refactoring engine that runs prepackaged, open source refactoring recipes for common framework migrations, security fixes, and stylistic consistency tasks.

OpenRewrite is Apache2 licensed and maintained by Moderne, the company that scales the use of OpenRewrite recipes across large codebases and multiple repositories.

Start with the [quickstart guide](https://docs.openrewrite.org/running-recipes/getting-started) and let OpenRewrite handle the boring parts of software development for you. We also welcome you to join our [community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rewriteoss/shared_invite/zt-1ihfggp2a-glIit_aXJnhHAdv_0uzwow).
